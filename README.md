# Electric Vehicle Performance and Consumer Experiences


![Presentation_Cover_Image](<Presentation/Images/Cover_and_General/Presentation_Cover.png>)

##Project Purpose
---

We explored data on electric vehicle (EV) attributes, performance, charging, and consumer experiences with a focus on how these are related to:
- *Attributes*: EV real-world fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions
- *Costs*:  The financial costs of buying and owning an EV
- *Charging*:  EV charging times and trends
- *Barriers*:  Barriers to EV adoption reported by consumers

##Project Questions
---
The questions were those we anticipated from an audience of vehicle manufacturers, EV engineers, and EV sales and marketing teams: 

- *Attributes: Real-world fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions*:
   - Which EV models and manufacturers have the highest fuel economy and carbon dioxide emission efficiencies?
   - When can we predict EVs will emit no carbon dioxide and possibly contribute to carbon negativity?
- *Costs: The financial costs of buying and owning an EV*:
   - What is the greatest cost from owning an EV?
   - How do costs of owning an EV change over time?
- *Charging: Charging time and needs*:
   - What day of the week do most people charge EVs?
   - Is there a relationship between EV charging time and kilowatt-hours?
- *Barriers:  Consumer barriers to EV adoption*:  
   - Who is most likely to purchase an EV?
   - Why do people not purchase an EV?


##Secondary Research
---
Our first step was to conduct secondary research on EVs.   The secondary research helped in the following ways:
- Broadened our understanding of the existing research on EVs
- Identified our stakeholders
- Narrowed our areas for exploration
- Identified data sources

The secondary research exposed us to the variety of EV types on the market.  

![EVTypes](<Presentation/Images/Cover_and_General/EV_Types.png>)

Based on the secondary research, available datasets, and the current focus in popular media on EV cars, we opted to focus on EV cars (passenger cars and sports vehicles) for Project 1.  Accordingly, we preprocessed datasets so *pickup truck, heavy utility, and commmerical vehicle data were not included in the analyses*. 

Our primary audiences in the EV community would be:
- Vehicle manufacturers
- Engineers  and designers
- Dealerships

Our primary challenge during Project 1 ocurred during the secondary research.  There are several private companies who are growing their datasets on EV efficiency, performance, and consumer sentiment.  However, these companies charge substantial licensing fees to access their data. Ultimately, we had to rely on publicly accessible data readily available on government websites or made available to us after asking and waiting for permissions.  For more details on these data sources, please see the next section.  


## About the Data
---

Each of the Project 1 teammates focused on one of four topics.  

### 1.) Attributes:  Real-world fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions

####Exploration(s):
- The relationship between EV model and real-world fuel economy
- Differences among manufacturers
- EV carbon dioxide (CO2) emission trends over time/time series forecast

####Possible variables:
*Independent variables/Features*:   Model, manufacturer, EV type (BEVs, HEVs, PHEVs, FCEVS) horsepower, weight, footprint/vehicle size, battery or engine, seating capacity

*Dependent variables/Labels*:  Fuel economy, CO2, Charging rate and speed
Sources:

####Data Source:
The primary dataset used for the explorations of EV attributes was the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) *Automotive Trends Data*.  The link to the complete dataset and supporting material follow:
https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/explore-automotive-trends-data

The dataset can be filtered for specific variables, though this can be challenging and seemed dependent on the browser used with *internet explorer* proving most effective.

**These are specific quotes from the EPA about the dataset**:
*“The Trends database includes all new light-duty vehicles in the United States.”*

*“The Trends database has been maintained by EPA since 1975 and is updated annually to include the most up to date data available for all model years.”*

*“All data are based on production volumes delivered for sale in the U.S. by model year, and may vary from publicized data based on calendar year sales.”*

#####*Licensure and Credits*:  
This dataset is open access. 
“Suggested data citation: US Environmental Protection Agency. 2023 EPA Automotive Trends Report. Data available at www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/explore-automotive-trends-data. Accessed December, 2023 and January, 2024.”

#####*Limitations of the Automotive Trends Data*:
The EPA's *Automotive Trends Data* did not start tracking EVs car models till 2010. Consequently, EV car models are a smaller subset of the much larger database. When interpreting findings about EVs from this dataset, it is recommended that the reader consider the limitations of a smaller sample size.    

### 2.) Costs:  The financial costs of buying and owning an EV
####Exploration(s):
* The five-year cost of owning an EV compared to owning a hybrid or internal combustion (gas) engine type vehicle
* The seven major yearly costs of owning a car including depreciation, interest on the car loan, taxes and fees, maintenance and repairs, insurance premiums, and fuel are considered


####Possible variables:
*Independent variables/Features*:
- Depreciation
   - On average, Edmund’s estimates that in the first year a typical vehicle will lose 23.5% of its manufacturer's suggested retail price and about 60% of its value after 5 years.
      - Estimates are based on auctions and retail data, supply and demand, pricing, incentives, redesign and improvements of newer models, like models, and the economy
   - Interest on the car loan
      - Based on tradition financing and not lease to own over a 60 months period
   - Taxes and fees
      - Assume 10% down payment
   - Maintenance and repairs
      - Estimated based on the manufacture's recommended suggestions as well as unscheduled types such as wheel alignments and replacement for wear and tear of the vehicle
   - Insurance premiums
   - Fuel
      - Cost is based the manufactures recommended fuel type and is estimated based on an average person driving 15,000 miles/year, with an admixture of 45% highway driving and 55% city.
   
   
*Dependent variables/Labels*:
- Age of car in years

####Data Source:
The data was extracted from the Edmund's true cost of to own https://www.edmunds.com/tco.html for the vehicles.  The data was scraped using the python script in Code/EVPerformance/reading_tables.py. The purpose of this script was to find and extract values in tables from the http file and concatenate them into their respective csv files found in Code/EVPerformance/Resources

#####*Licensure and Credits*:
The api is no longer open.  The data was extracted into csv files for analysis.


#####*Limitations*:
The data was limited to the 2023 model year and car models ranging in cost from $26k - $113k.  The cost range was constrained to allow for a fairer comparison among engine types. 




### 3.) Charging:  Charging times and trends
####Exploration(s): 
The charging behavior Electric Vehicle users.
The time it takes to charge an Elecric Vehicle.
What days and how long is the typical Electric Vehicle User charging theri behcicles. 

####Possible variables:
*Independent variables/Features*:   
Locations of charging stations.
Metro areas with charging stations clusters.
EV sales by models
Trips by length
Private EV chaging stations
Private and public EV charging stations 

*Dependent variables/Labels*:  
Days of the week

####Data Source:
the data was recieved by Chargepoint, Inc..   Chargepoint is the second largest charging point supplier in the United States behind Tesla, Inc.   A team member emailed Chargepoint and they sent back a dataset detailing charging times, charging locations and days of the week.
#####*Licensure and Credits*:  
Chargepoint, Inc. 
#####*Limitations*: 
Chargepoint represents 14,155 level 2 locations which includes 48,946 charging plugs.   This is in contrast to the 160,000 actual public and private charging locations in the United States.   


### 4.) Barriers: Consumer barriers to EV adoption

 - The reasons consumers are hesitant to adopt EVs
 - Demographics of EV buyers
 - Concerns of consumers
 - Exposure of consumers to EVs

####Possible variables:
*Variables/Features*:   Ethnicity, gender, education, age, perceived barriers to purchase 


####Data Source: 
2022 BEV and LCF Survey Report_FINAL_2 (consumerreports.org) 
*More Americans Would Buy an EV | Interest in Low-Carbon Fuels* - Consumer Reports

#####*Licensure and Credits*:  
Open access


#####*Limitations*: 
The data was from reports.  The data was scraped from the reports and analyzied.   .

#####Takeaway:
EVs are trending toward zero CO2 emissions by 2027.  However, the small sample size does limite this interpretation.  


### 2.) Costs: The financial costs of buying and owning an EV:

#### Exploration:  How do costs change over time?
#####Code:

EVPerformance/analysis_5year_ownership_all.ipynb

#####Takeaway:
<figure>

<figcaption> Fig cost: The yearly cost to own for a internal combustion (left panel), hybrid (center panel) and electric type(right panel) vehicles.
</figcaption>
</figure>

The absolute total yearly cost to own for all internal combustion, hybrid and electric car models being is plotted in Fig cost. Each line color represents a different model car. In each case, the first year of ownership appears to be the most expensive. There are large variations in the cost for the first year due to the range of car prices being considered. After the first year, the fluctuations in the cost of ownership between each model vehicles decreases. 

<figure>
<img src = "Presentation/Images/EVPerformance/cost_per_mile.png", alt = "cost_per_mile">
<figcaption> Fig cost/year: The average yearly cost/millage to own for a internal combustion (left panel), hybrid (center panel) and electric (right panel) vehicles.
</figcaption>
</figure>

To understand cost by engine type, the average cost per mile of ownership is calculated and displayed in fig cost/year. The cost is further broken down into the seven major yearly expenses being considered in this case study: depreciation, interest on the loan, taxes and fees, maintenance and repairs, insurance premiums, and fuel. In general, the fig cost/year illustrates that maintenance and repairs, purple and brown part of the bar graph, respectively, will increase over time due to wear and tear while the costs due to depreciation, financing, and taxes and fees, represented by the blue, orange and pink parts of the bar graph, respectively, will decreases with the age of the vehicle.

#### Exploration:  What is the greatest cost from owning an EV?
#####Takeaway:

Regardless of the engine types, the first year has the largest expense. The EVs are more expensive to own the 1st year compared to the internal combustion engine car type by \$0.55/mile, and the hybrid car type by \$0.32/mile compared to the traditional gas vehicles. In the second year, the cost of ownership decreases significantly by about 50%-65% (when compared to the first year).

  </table>

From the table above, the total costs to maintain an electric, hybrid and internal combustion type car or the sum of costs for all years for a given engine type, is \$4.96/mile, \$5.68/mile and \$4.87/mile, respectively. Thus, after five years, the cost of owning an ev is about \$0.09/mile more expensive in over five years compared to the internal combustion. This means that the break even point of an electric and hybrid car compared to an gasoline vehicle takes longer than five years.

<figcaption> Fig depreciation: The average yearly depreciation for a internal combustion (top panels), hybrid (middle panels) and electric (bottom panels) vehicles.
</figcaption>
</figure>

Fig depreciation is the breakdown of the yearly cost of the largest expense, the depreciation verses the initial cost of the vehicle. There is a clear linear correlation between most of the models vs cost. This indicates that one can decrease the cost of ownership by buying a cheaper vehicle. The gradients of the EV and internal combustion engines are similar for the first two years, but the offset for the EV is larger indicating that regardless of which price point one chooses, the depreciation for an EV will be larger during these two years. There appears to be a few higher priced EVs that seems to retain their value, i.e. smaller depreciation. These few models represent the exception to the linear trend observed. 

<figure>
<img src = "Presentation/Images/EVPerformance/YearlyPercentageOfCost.png", alt = "Yearly%ofCost"> <figcaption> Fig Yearly Percentage of Cost: The average yearly depreciation for a internal combustion (left panel), hybrid (center panel) and electric (right panel) vehicles.
</figcaption>
</figure>

Fig Yearly Percentage of Cost is the normalized distribution of the cost for each year for each engine type. After the first year, roughly 30% of the cost to own can be attributed to the depreciation while the insurance premiums and taxes and fees contributes 11-20% and 1.5-2.5%, respectively. The financing cost drops significantly as one starts to pay off the car, but the maintenance and repairs increases.

### 3.) Charging: Charging time and needs:
#### Exploration:  What day of the week do most people charge EVs?
#####Code:
```
## Import the required libraries and dependencies
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as st
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

## Convert excel file generated by API to a Pandas dataframe.
df = pd.read_excel('/Users/kim/Desktop/ev.charge.xlsx')

## Groupby 'weekday' and calculate the mean of 'chargeTimeHrs'
average_charge_time = df.groupby('weekday')['chargeTimeHrs'].mean()

## Sort the average charge time in descending order
average_charge_time2 = average_charge_time.sort_values(ascending=False)

##Plot
average_charge_time2.plot(kind='bar')

# Add labels and title
plt.title('Average Charge Time by Weekday')
plt.xlabel('Weekday')
plt.ylabel('Average Charge Time (Hrs)')

#Show plot
plt.show()

```
#####Graph:
![EVCharge_WD.ipynb](<Presentation/Images/EVCharging/EVCharge_TBWD.png>)

#####Takeaway:
Average overall charge is 2.82 hours, using 5.81kW. Charge times are greatest on Wednesdays with an average of 2.94 hours needed to charge an EV. Sunday is the lowest at 2.1 hours. It is not until the weekend days that we see a substantial drop in the hours needed to charge an electric vehicle. There is only a gradual decline over the days of the work week.

#### Is there a relationship between EV charging time and kilowatt-hours?

df= pd.read_excel("ev.charge.xlsx")
df.head()
df.dtypes
df.info()

##Plot
plt.scatter(df['chargeTimeHrs'], df['kwhTotal'])
plt.xticks(rotation=33)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.title("Time to charge and EV", fontsize=20)
plt.xlabel("Time in Hours", fontsize=15)
plt.ylabel("Kilowatt Per Hour", fontsize=15)
plt.tick_params(axis = 'both', which = 'major', labelsize=8)
plt.show()
```

#####Graph:

![EVCTtoKWH](<Presentation/Images/EVCharging/EVCTtoKWH.png>)

#####Takeaway:
The amount of kilowatts per hour used tends to increase with charge time.  However, some of the charges can lag nearly up to 12 hours. Another group of charge times seems to take less than 4 hours to charge but with greater amount of kilowatts per hour. 


### 4.) Barriers: Consumer barriers to EV adoption  
#### Exploration:  Who is most likely to purchase an EV?
#####Code:
```
## Import the required libraries and dependencies
import pandas as pd
from prophet import Prophet
import datetime as dt
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

#Convert excel document to a Pandas dataframe
df = pd.read_excel('ev.cost.barriers.xlsx')

##Plot
x_values= df["Race"]
y_values= df["EV"]
plt.plot(x_values, y_values)
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.title("Percentage of People Concerned about EV Costs", fontsize=12)
plt.xlabel("Race", fontsize=15)
plt.ylabel("Percentage of People", fontsize=15)
plt.tick_params(axis = 'both', which = 'major', labelsize=8)
plt.show()
```

#####Graph:  
![FCast](<Presentation/Images/ConsumerExperience/BarriersToEVAdoption.png>)
#####Takeaway: 
The demographics of a typical EV buyer are male, young adult, with a higher education, a higher income level and live in an urban area. 

#### Exploration:  Why do people not purchase an EV?
#####Code:
```
# Import the required libraries and dependencies
import pandas as pd
from prophet import Prophet
import datetime as dt
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

#Convert excel document to a Pandas dataframe
df = pd.read_excel('EV.barriers.xlsx')
df.head()

##Plot
x_values= df["Bar"]
y_values= df["Percentage"]
plt.plot(x_values, y_values)
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.title("Barriers to EV Adoption", fontsize=12)
plt.xlabel("Concerns", fontsize=15)
plt.ylabel("Percentage of People", fontsize=12)
plt.tick_params(axis = 'both', which = 'major', labelsize=8)
plt.show()
```

#####Graph:  
![FCast](<Presentation/Images/ConsumerExperience/ConsumerConcerns.png>)
#####Takeaway: 
The majority of consumers are not knowledgeable on the subject of EVs, many not even having driven one.  Without this knowledge, they are hesitant to make a purchase.
